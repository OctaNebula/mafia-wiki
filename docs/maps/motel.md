## **In-Game**
---
The **Motel** map has a total of 7 **closets** dotted around each motel room. Closets do not appear in the corridors or the sitting room.

The map also has a total of 12 **lockers**, which are mainly in the corridors of this map.

There are a total of 8 enterable rooms in this map, not including the corridors or the main sitting room. 

Windows can be found along the edges of the map. When a player approaches the window, the sound of rain will grow louder. Lightning can also be seen in these windows; the lightning makes a loud sound every few seconds and flashes up parts of the map.

The sitting room has a total of 20 chairs.

The map has a total of 3 main corridors.

It is confined in space in comparison to maps such as the **Library** or the **Subway Station**, acting as a disadvantage for the members of the Mafia as they must be discreet in their murders.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
If you are a **Civilian**, make sure to keep within the main corridors of the map. This is a small map. Staying in large crowds prevents the members of the **Mafia** targeting a player who is alone.

If you are part of the **Mafia**, be sure to spot out **Civilians** who are in one of the rooms. Targeting players in a room, which is closed off, lowers your chances of getting caught.

Members of the **Mafia** should check **closets** and **lockers** in this map as they aren't far away from each other. **Civilians** are more likely to hide in **closets** and **lockers** because it is a small map.

If you are a **Witch**, try and curse somebody who is inside of a room rather than a corridor. 

If you are a **Vigilante**, keep in large gatherings of people. Try not to wander off into concealed rooms as this will make it easier for members of the **Mafia** to target you.

This is one of the best maps if you end up being a **Detective** as it is a smaller space compared to the other maps. You can easily spot out footsteps with your special ability.

If you are a **Detainer**, try and arrest somebody in a room rather than a corridor. Members of the **Mafia** will see you as an immediate threat if you cuff somebody in a corridor as they will find out your role.

If you are a **Doctor**, try keep central to this map as you'll be able to hear **gunshots** or **knife** stabs more easily. With this, you can hear the direction of the attack and go and aid the wounded **Civilian**.

If you are part of the **Mafia**, try plan your attacks away from the windows. Lightning strikes from outside the map light up areas of the map. If a **Civilian** spots you killing somebody and thunder strikes, they will see you very clearly.

The sitting room is the largest space in the map. **Civilians** could try and hang around there to avoid members of the **Mafia** striking in dark spaces.
## **Trivia**
---

There was no **Motel** map present in **OG Mafia**. 

This map has undergone several changes in preparation for the re-released version of the game. Changes spanned from the 15th of January 2024 to the 25th of March 2025.

It is one of the only maps to feature windows. 

This map was partially inspired by The Mimic's own 'Hotel' map.
