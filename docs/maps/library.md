## **In-Game**

The **Library** map has four rooms. The most significant room in the game is the 'Grand Foyer', which is the largest.

The 'Grand Staircase' allows players to travel to the first and second floors.

One of the 3 other rooms includes 'Staircase A', which can be found on the eastern side of the first floor.

This staircase leads to the 'Upper Landing', which conveys a landing of books for storage. This area has invisible fences, preventing players from falling down.

One of the other rooms includes the 'Storage' room, the smallest room in the map. This can be found on the western side of the map, on the ground floor, below the western side of the 'Grand Staircase'.

The final room is the sitting room, which has a total of 20 chairs for 20 players. This room is on the eastern side of the map, on the ground floor, below the eastern side of the 'Grand Staircase'.

The **Library** map has a total of 16 **closets** dotted around the map. Closets do not appear in the sitting room.

The 'Main Entrance' can be found northwards of the map.

The map features one large window found southwards to the map. Players who walk near to the window will hear raindrops. Lightning strikes can be seen every few seconds, lighting up a significant portion of the map.

It is the biggest map in the game, both in width and height. 

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
If you become a **Civilian**, make sure to keep within the 'Grand Foyer' in large crowds as members of the **Mafia** will be less likely to kill you in such an open space. 

**Civilians** could travel to the 'Upper Landing' though should keep in mind that there is only one way in and one way out. Trapping yourself in the 'Upper Landing' will allow members of the **Mafia** to creep up on you and kill you.

**Civilians** should also try and avoid the 'Storage' room as it is a very small room without a door. If the **Civilians** aren't in the 'Grand Foyer', there is more of a chance that members of the **Mafia** will peek into the 'Storage' room and look for **Civilians** hiding in the closets.

As this map does not feature any **lockers**, make sure to only hide in a **closet** if you are sure of your surroundings. If you do decide to hide in a **closet**, make sure to peek out of it every 15-20 seconds to see if anybody's near you.

If you are part of the **Mafia**, this map is very difficult to orchestrate killings in. Visit the 'Storage' room and the sitting room to see if any **Civilians** are hiding in there, so you can kill them without alerting everybody who may be in the 'Grand Foyer'. You can also visit the 'Upper Landing' as there is only one way in and one way out. **Civilians** who get themselves stuck in the 'Upper Landing' don't have a way out if you surround them.

This map is also difficult for the **Detective**. If you are a **Detective**, try and look for footsteps, using your special ability, in smaller rooms such as the 'Storage' room, 'Upper Landing', or the sitting room. Footsteps are more likely to show up and stay in smaller rooms rather than huge spaces such as the 'Grand Foyer'.

Avoid getting stuck on either side of the first floor as these landings (with bookshelves on the sides) are dead ends. 

If you are a **Witch**, try and curse people in smaller rooms too. Alerting everybody around you, such as in the 'Grand Foyer', will expose your role to everybody in the game, causing them to vote you out no matter what side you're on.

Avoid getting stuck in 'Staircase A'. This staircase is very long. It allows members of the **Mafia** to trap **Civilians** in this staircase, and vice versa.

If you are a **Doctor**, make sure to keep central to the 'Grand Foyer' as this will give you easy transportation to get to each room in the map. If you hear a wounded player, or an attack being orchestrated, you can easily define where the sound is coming from and go towards the area.

No matter your role, make sure to look behind you every few seconds. This map is very large, so therefore very dark. Somebody could be following you or creeping up on you without you noticing. 
## **Trivia**
---

There was no **Library** map present in **OG Mafia**.

This map took a month to build. Building spanned from the 9th of September 2024 to the 9th of October 2024.

It is the laggiest map in the game due to the amount of lights needed to fill in dark spots.

This map was heavily inspired from the game Epic Mickey, specifically the Lonesome Manor Library map. You can see this in the design of the 'Grand Foyer' and the 'Upper Landing'.
