## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Judge** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During **discussion** time, the **Judge** must break the tie by deciding who to eliminate out of all players who have tied. This can only be one player.

The **Judge** must communicate with other **Civilians** to make sure who they vote out is suspect of being part of the **Mafia**. 

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
As the **Judge**, you are still part of the **Good Team**, meaning you must survive the **night** and avoid being voted out.

Try and spot out who is most likely to be suspicious of being part of the **Evil Team**. By breaking a tie between a **Civilian** and a possible **Mafia**, voting out the **Mafia** will aid your team towards succession.

You can spot this out by observing accusations during **discussion** time. If the majority of players think one individual is part of the **Mafia**, and that individual ends up tying with another player, vote out the most suspicious player.

Avoid being killed during the **night** as if a tie happens and the **Judge** is not present, the game moves onto the next round. This allows the **Mafia** to eliminate more **Civilians**.

You can reveal your role as the **Judge** if a tie is bound to happen. You are still pretty much a **Civilian**, but with a special ability. This will also aid in proving your innocence if the **Civilians** suspect you as being part of the **Mafia**. 

Avoid making enemies with the **Evil Team** as they may target you during the **night**. 

Avoid aiding the **Mafia** by voting out deemed **Civilians** during a tie. If you vote out a **Civilian**, the **Mafia** have more leverage.

Avoid being put into jail by the **Detainer** as if a tie occurs, the game does not register a **Judge** being present and therefore moves onto the next round. You can do this by spotting who the **Detainer** is, and explaining to them that you are the **Judge**. 
## **Trivia**
---

The **Judge** was implemented in the advanced game mode of **OG Mafia**. 

The likeliness of a **Judge** actually being present in the game is pretty low. Players tend to leave if they are the **Judge** as it is less powerful compared to the other roles.

When a **Judge** breaks a tie, they get 5 **credits** and 10 **XP**.
