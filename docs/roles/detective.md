## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Detective** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During the **night**, the **Detective** must trace footsteps from the members of the Mafia by using their special ability. The **Detective** does this by either:
- Clicking on the screen (PC)
- Pressing the button on the screen (Mobile)

With the special ability, the **Detective** gains a different vision and is able to see orange footsteps on the floor of the map they are playing in. These footsteps disappear after x seconds, so the **Detective** must be quick with their findings.

During **discussion**, the **Detective** can figure out who voted to **skip the votes**, regardless if they were skipped or not. They get a list of people who voted to skip votes after each **discussion** period. They can use this to see who constantly skips votes, allowing the **Detective** to correlate **skipping votes** with a chance of the player being part of the **Mafia**.

This can help the **Detective** aid the **Civilians** by giving hints as to whose footsteps they saw, and question specific players for skipping votes multiple times in a row.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
As the **Detective**, you must travel round the **map** and use your special ability to trace footsteps from **Evil** players. This is most likely to be seen in crowd gatherings.

Avoid revealing your role too early in the game as members of the **Mafia** will target you immediately. You could reveal your role when the game is near the end, when there are 1 or 2 members of the **Mafia** remaining in the game, as **Civilians** will have outnumbered the **Evil Team**.

When tracking footsteps, make sure you're not in concealed spaces or quiet areas. This makes it easier for members of the **Mafia** to target you as you are alone.

When seeing who skipped votes, do not overtly accuse individuals of skipping the votes immediately. Wait and see if the same players continuously skip votes, and confront them later on in the game.

Footsteps disappear after a few seconds, meaning that you must be quick with tracing suspicious players. Find a suspicious player to target, make sure you're within a crowd of **Civilians**, and see if their footsteps show on your special ability.

Avoid being arrested by the **Detainer** as this will reduce the chances of **Civilians** winning.

If you are accused at any point of the game, explain your suspicions of somebody else rather than yourself. Immediately getting scared and revealing your role would place you at risk of being voted out or murdered.

Avoid the **Witch** at all times as you won't be able to back up your accusations during **discussion** time. 

Work with the **Doctor** as they will most likely be heading to the wounded body. This gives you more of a chance to see the footsteps from members of the **Mafia** as they would be near the wounded body.

If you do see the footsteps from a member of the **Mafia**, go in a different direction. They may be luring you to somewhere quiet to eventually kill you.
## **Trivia**
---

In **OG Mafia**, the **Detective** role could find out the roles of each player every round. 

If the **Detective** votes a member of the **Mafia** out, they will get 4 **credits** and 8 **XP** for voting out the correct player.
