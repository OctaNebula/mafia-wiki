## **In-Game**
---
This section explains the mechanics of the **Mafia** role.

On a 10-14 player server, there are 2 **Mafia** in the game. The chance of a player obtaining the role of the **Mafia** is currently **20%** if there are 10 players in a server. This changes to **40%** if a player purchases the **2X Mafia Chance** game pass.

On a 15-20 player server, there are 3 **Mafia** in the game. The chance of a player obtaining the role of the **Mafia** is currently **15%** if the server is full. This changes to **30%** if a player purchases the **2X Mafia Chance** game pass.

The **Mafia** eliminate **one** player per night with either a **gun** or a **knife**. If a **Mafia** is at maximum **X studs away** from their target, the game will force them to eliminate with a **knife**. If a **Mafia** is at maximum **X studs away** from their target, the game will force them to eliminate with a **gun.**

The main difference between eliminating with a knife and a gun is the **noise level**. 

A **gunshot** can be heard from **X studs away**, with a visible **flash** on the screens on the players able to be witnessed if a player is **X studs away** from the gunshot.
- The upside to using a **gun** is the longer range; a **Mafia** can target a player from **X-Y studs**. 
- The downside to using a **gun** is the noise and visible flash occurring.

A **stab** can be heard from **X studs away**, with no flash occurring. 
- The upside to using a **knife** is the noise; it is quieter and no flash occurs. 
- The downside to using a **knife** is the shorter range. A **Mafia** can only target an individual between **X-Y studs**, making it more difficult to target individuals with a knife if there are a lot of players in one area.

**Noise** serves as an important factor in the game as it alerts all players within the range of the noise to exactly where the sound occurred. To combat this, the Mafia must figure out the **perfect location** to eliminate players. This can be **concealed or small** rooms, or **large but majorly decorated** rooms.
  
Both weapons are **instantly fatal**, *though this depends on if the player has the X perk*. This perk allows the player to eliminate their target quicker by **50%**, though the chances of the player instantly dying is **5 in 6**.

In the game, the **Evil Team** has their own private chat. With the private chat, the **Evil Team** can discuss tactics, targets, location, and more. The private chat is key to succession as the **Evil Team** must communicate effectively to win and avoid being caught by the **Civilians**.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---

This section explains tips and tricks for players who end up being part of the **Mafia**.

Do not reveal that you are part of the **Mafia** at any point in the game. Revealing that you are part of the **Mafia** will result in **Civilians** voting you out immediately. This is because if you are voted out, even if the **Mafia** win you will not earn **credits** or **XP** for winning.

Blend in with the **Civilians**. You can earn the **Civilians'** trust if you match their mood. If the server is quiet, stay quiet. If they're talking a lot, talk along with them. If one of the **Civilians** accuse one of your teammates, understand their accusations but explain why you don't think it's them (one of your teammates) to convince the majority vote. If the majority of **Civilians** are stood still on the map and not doing anything, only strike if they start moving around, or don't do anything. If the majority of **Civilians** are walking around each corner of the map, make sure you eliminate a player in a concealed or quiet room. If the majority of **Civilians** are hiding in **closets** or **lockers**, hide in one of the two and act as if you're hiding from the **Mafia**.

Do not accuse random **Civilians**. Accusing random **Civilians** will only bring suspicion to you, as it will make you out to seem as if you are trying to eliminate people via **discussion** rather than during the **night**.

Do not act too innocent. Pretending you don't know anything about the game or acting terrified can direct the suspicions onto you otherwise. 

Try eliminate players who aren't suspicious about you. Eliminating players who don't think you are part of the **Mafia** will allow your accusers to less likely believe you are part of the **Mafia**. Be careful with this though. If you keep too many accusers alive, they will eventually suspect it is you.

Walk around the map and find **Civilians** to accuse if they 'seem' suspicious to the average player. For example, if a player is hiding in a closet the entire round, or seems to always be around when a player gets eliminated, you can accuse them for either 'hiding' or 'being near the body'.

Confront silent **Civilians**. By confronting **Civilians** for being silent, it gets them talking. After a while, the entire server will agree with you on the fact that they've been quiet for a long time.

If one of the **Evil Team** betray you, do not hesitate to strike back. For example, one of your teammates may accuse you of being the **Mafia** during discussion. You can strike back with hypothetical examples such as 'You were right next to the body when I saw you.'

Only **report** bodies every few rounds. If you **report** a body every time you kill a player, it becomes too suspicious and the **Civilians** will suspect you of self-reporting. 

Depart the wounded player immediately. If a **Doctor** is present during the round, the **eliminated** player will become **wounded** instead of instantly dying, *unless you obtain the X perk*. If the **wounded** player becomes healed by the **Doctor**, the **wounded** player will return to **discussion** accusing you immediately. Depart the area, or hide in a **closet** or **locker**. 

Avoid getting arrested by the **Detainer**. If you get arrested, you do not return to the game until the next **discussion** period. This means you miss an entire night, and may not be able to eliminate anybody. If the game determines that 'nobody has died tonight', the **Civilians** will have sufficient evidence to determine you as the **Mafia**. You can avoid getting arrested if you do not make yourself look suspicious by walking around, being near civilians, being in open spaces, and more.

Avoid getting **cursed** by the **Witch** if the **Witch** is part of the **Civilians**. The **Witch** prevents a player from talking during **discussion** time. If you get cursed, you can't back yourself or your teammates up. You can do this by avoiding suspicion, you cannot be accused by the majority of **Civilians** otherwise the **Witch** is bound to curse you from talking.

Avoid getting caught out by the **Detective**. **Detectives** can see **footsteps** from the **Mafia**, which do eventually disappear however stay there for **X seconds**. If a **Detective** catches you out, they will accuse you during **discussion** time. Avoid this by eliminating players that seem to constantly follow you around the map. Lead the player to a small or concealed corner, and eliminate them. If the **Detective** accuses you during **discussion** time, you can fire back at them by suspecting them of 'being part of the Mafia' due to such 'irrational accusations'.

Avoid **skipping votes** every round. **Detectives** get a list of players who have **skipped votes** if votes do get skipped. If your name appears on that list too many times, the **Detective** may suspect you as being part of the **Mafia**.

Work with the **Witch** if they are part of the **Evil Team**. You can work with the **Witch** in your private chat. Tell them to target individuals who accuse you or your teammates as being part of the **Mafia**, as it will prevent the accuser talking during **discussion** to accuse you even more.

Prioritise killing **unique roles** over **Civilians**. Try and eliminate roles such as **Detective**, **Doctor**, **Detainer**, and the **Vigilante** as they can easily allow **Civilians** to start suspecting you. 

Avoid eliminating the **Vigilante** immediately and let them suspect a **Civilian**. The **Vigilante** only has one shot to eliminate a **Mafia**, otherwise they die if they eliminate a **Civilian**. Let them suspect someone else and they'll eventually kill themselves too. If the **Vigilante** starts accusing you, make sure to hide in concealed spaces and away from groups of people. You'll eventually lure them in and you can kill them first.
