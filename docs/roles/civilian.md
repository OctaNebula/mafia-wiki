        The <b> Civilian </b> role is part of the <b> Good Roles </b>, also known as Civilians. It is the most common role in the game, and has no significant abilities. This role appears in both Normal and <b>Disguised</b> rounds.<p> The <b> Civilian </b> serves an important function to the game; Civilians determine who to vote out during <b> discussion </b> time. They vote out who they think are part of the <b> Mafia </b> in order to win.

## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, there would be 9 **Civilians** present. The chance of obtaining the **Civilian** role would therefore be 45%.

The lowest chance of obtaining the **Civilian** role is in an 11 player server, where the chance lowers to 9.1%.

The **Civilians** eliminate one player per round during the **discussion** period via **voting**. If the player **Civilians** agree on ends up having the most votes, the chosen individual is voted out of the game.

**Civilians** must survive the **night** and walk around the **maps** to look for suspicious behaviour to use as evidence during **discussion** time.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
Do not act suspicious and make sure to look around for suspicious behaviour during the **night** and during **discussion** time.

If you're unsure of who to vote for, go with the majority. You can spot this by other people communicating on who to vote for, as well as during voting time where their hands will point at their target.

Make sure to not stay quiet, but don't talk too much. If you come across as knowing 'too much', you will be seen as suspicious by other **Civilians**, and the **Mafias** may target you due to you being a threat to their team.

Try not to leave the game if you get the **Civilian** role. It is annoying when you don't have a unique role, but you still earn **credits** and **XP** for your efforts. Leaving the game results in the **Mafia** having more power over **Civilians**.

During the **night**, stay in large groups of people to avoid **Mafias** eliminating you in empty spaces or concealed rooms. 

If somebody accuses you of being part of the **Mafia**, try your best to explain why you're not a **Mafioso** without revealing your role. If you reveal your role based off of hearsay, players will have a hard time believing you and vote you out instead.

Subtly accuse the **Mafioso** you surely know is evil. Hint during **discussion** time of what you saw and back this up with people you may have seen around the area of suspicious activity. You can also do this by **reporting bodies** if you happen to find one during the night. With this, you can use it as evidence to prove you found one of the **Mafias'** victims.

As your role has no special abilities, your main task is to survive the night and look for suspicious activity. 

Do not stay quiet as the **Witch** may curse you during the night, leading to you not being able to speak during the next **discussion** period. If the **Civilians** point out the fact you're not talking at all for the round you've been cursed, they will see you as suspicious for being 'quiet' and vote you out.

Avoid making enemies as one of them may be a **Jester**. If the **Jester** is voted out and you happen to have had arguments with them, they will target you during their revenge night.

If you are at brink of being voted out, tell the **Detainer** (if they have revealed their role) to arrest your during the night. This will lead to somebody still being eliminated during the **night**, proving to other **Civilians** that you are not part of the **Mafia**.

Avoid acting as if you have a unique role as this makes you more suspicious to other **Civilians**.
## **Trivia**
---

The **Civilian** is the most common role in the game, spanning from a chance of 9% to 45%.

**Civilians** earn 5 **credits** and 10 **XP** for winning a game. They also earn 2 **credits** and 4 **XP** if they survive the **night**, and 1 **credit** and 2 **XP** if they don't get voted out during **discussion** time.

On a 10 player server, no **Civilians** are present. This is because there would be 10 players already in unique roles.

Since the **Civilian** has no special abilities aside from the perks they can use, people tend to immediately leave the game.

In **OG Mafia**, **Civilians** used to be called Innocents as well as **Civilians**.

On a 20 player server, there would be 16 or 17 players on the **Good Team** depending on if the **Witch** has chosen to be part of the **Evil Team**. 

None of the game passes allow players to get double chances for obtaining this role.
