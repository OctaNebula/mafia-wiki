## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Witch** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

Before the game explains the rules, the player is chosen their role by the game and must choose to be a part of either the **Good** or **Evil** team. This affects how they choose to play the game.

If the **Witch** chooses to be a part of the **Good** team, they must work with the **Civilians** to curse any **Mafias** to prevent them from talking during the next **discussion** period. This can lead to a **Mafioso** not having the ability to defend themselves when being accused by the **Civilians**.

If the **Witch** chooses to be a part of the **Evil** team, they must work with the **Mafias** to curse any **Civilians** to prevent them from talking during the next **discussion** period. This can increase the chances of succession for the **Evil Team** as it suppresses a **Civilian's** ability to talk, preventing them from exposing the **Evil Team**.

The **Witch**, if part of the **Evil Team**, joins the **Mafias'** private chat, allowing them to communicate with the **Mafias** and target individuals.

The **Witch** curses people during each **night** by clicking on their chosen target. This curse lasts until the next **night**.

If the **Witch** chooses to be a part of the **Evil Team** and all of the **Mafias** get voted out, the **Civilians** still win.

In a 20 player server, if all **Mafias** remain in the game along with their **Witch**, the game ends when there are 4 **Civilians** left as the number of players in the **Evil Team** will outnumber the amount of **Civilians**.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
As the **Witch**, you must avoid being caught out by the opposite side. If, for example, the **Civilians** see you cursing a **Civilian**, they will be quick to vote you out first.

As a **Witch** on the **Good** side, avoid cursing a **Mafioso** every single night as they will be quick to eliminate you, as you pose a threat to them.

If you are a **Witch** on the **Evil** side, you cannot curse your own teammates. Do not try and do this, as players will see you as suspicious.

If you are a **Witch** on the **Good** side, avoid cursing too many **Civilians** even if you don't realise it because they will determine you as 'betraying' them.

Cursing a player is very loud. Make sure to curse players in concealed spaces or empty rooms and hide in a **locker** or **closet** afterwards, or leave the area completely. 

Do not reveal your role to the **Civilians** if you're on the **Good** side as they will suspect you of being on the **Evil** side. 

If you are on the **Evil** side, make sure that your private chat is not accidentally on the **Mafias** private chat during discussion. If you say the wrong thing in the wrong chat, **Civilians** will immediately suspect you and vote you out.

Even if the **Mafias** win and you die, you do not get rewards for winning the game. Make sure to stay in the game as long as possible.

If you are on the **Good** side, do not be obvious with your role. If the **Mafias** suspect you, they will immediately see you as their biggest threat and vote you out.

Avoid being arrested by the **Detainer** no matter what side you're on as this will slow your chances of succession for your team. Try and curse the **Detainer** in a subtle way (e.g. behind them) if you're confident enough.

If a player suspects you of being the **Witch**, you could say you are the **Jester** to avoid players voting you out. 

Avoid making enemies with the **Jester** as they are not on the **Evil** nor the **Good** side. If they kill you, you're out of the game, and your team is more likely to lose.
## **Trivia**
---

The **Witch** was first introduced in the advanced game mode of **OG Mafia**.

Cursing a player leads to obtaining 2 **credits** and 4 **XP**.

The **Witch** cannot curse their own teammates if they choose the **Evil** side.

The **Witch** can choose not to curse anybody during the night.

The cursed player experiences a fuzzy, flashy screen when they are cursed. They're blinded for a few seconds before their vision turns to semi-normal.

When the **Witch** curses a player, the sound of the curse can span across 40 studs.
