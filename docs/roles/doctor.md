## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Doctor** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During the **night**, the **Doctor** must be on high alert and hear where murders have taken place. They would hear this by either a **gunshot** or a **knife** stab. 

Once the **Doctor** knows where the murders have happened, they must get to the wounded player in under 30 seconds otherwise the wounded player dies.

**Doctors** save attacked **Civilians** by clicking on the wounded player to heal them and bring them back to the game.

If the **Doctor** saves the wounded player, nobody dies during the **night** *unless a **Jester** strikes their revenge or the **Vigilante** kills a **Mafioso**.* 

It acts as one of the most beneficial roles to the **Civilians** as the **Doctor** is important in keeping the player count up. If the player count of **Civilians** meets the count of the **Evil Team**, the **Civilians** lose.

It is also one of the most threatening roles to the **Mafias** as they will try and eliminate the **Doctor** as soon as possible to have a 100% chance of killing somebody during the **night**.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
As the **Doctor**, you must keep in large crowds of **Civilians** and hear out for any distant **gunshots** or **knife** stabs. Once you hear these, you must go towards the direction of the murder within 30 seconds to save the wounded player.

Do not reveal your role unless you want to be targeted by the **Mafias**. The **Doctor** serves as one of the most threatening roles to the **Mafias**.

Avoid being arrested by the **Detainer** as that means you cannot save anybody for one **night**.

Avoid making enemies with the **Jester** as they can kill anybody during their revenge night. If you're dead, you can't save anybody, and are giving the **Mafias** a bigger chance of succession.

Try and figure out who the **Detective** is as soon as possible as they will be following the footsteps of the **Mafias**. By following these footsteps, you can figure out who the **Mafias** most likely are, and where they may strike.

Try and keep within the centre of the **maps**. You can go in one of four directions if you hear a **gunshot** or a **knife** stab. 

Avoid hiding in **closets** and **lockers** as this role requires you to be on the move for almost the entire **night**. 

Realistically, you don't have to save anybody. Though in doing so you will be aiding the **Mafias** and their chances of succession.

If somebody accuses you of being part of the **Mafia**, you shouldn't reveal your role unless the majority are accusing you. 

Remember that you cannot heal yourself. 
## **Trivia**
---

In **OG Mafia**, there could be up to 2 **Doctors**.

The **Doctor** earns 4 **credits** and 8 **XP** for every person they save.

In comparison to the popular social deduction game Werewolf or Mafia, the **Doctor** cannot save themselves in this game.
