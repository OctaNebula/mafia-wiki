## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Suppressor** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During **discussion** time, the **Suppressor** must observe players who may suspiciously accuse the wrong players of being part of the **Mafia**. 

The **Suppressor** blocks a player from voting during the **discussion** period, giving them 60 seconds to do so. When **voting time** begins, the targeted player will be notified that their votes have been blocked. 

To block a player from voting, the **Suppressor** simply clicks on a player during **discussion** time.

The **Suppressor** can do this every round, with the votes being blocked for one player lasting only one **round**.

Therefore, the **Suppressor** acts as a moral guide for the **Civilians**. This is because if just one vote is blocked from an individual, it can change the outcome of the votes and therefore change who stays in the game. 

By blocking votes, it can reduce the chances of a tie occurring. If a tie occurs, the **Judge**, if present, decides who to eliminate. If no **Judge** is present, the game moves onto the next **night**.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
As the **Suppressor** you should observe communication patterns during **discussion** time. Look out for players who seem to accuse the same person every round. They are more than likely to be part of the **Mafia**; you can block their votes to prevent them from accusing the same person again.

You should not reveal you role as the **Suppressor** as the members of the **Mafia** will see you as a risk and try to eliminate you as soon as possible. 

Try and spot out who the **Judge** is as you can work together to either: prevent a tie occurring, or you can allow a tie to happen. You would want a tie to happen if half of the server is accusing a **Civilian** and the other half is accusing somebody who is part of the **Mafia**. If you try and make a tie happen, the **Judge** will therefore vote out the member of the **Mafia** rather than the **Civilian**.

Try and avoid being arrested by the **Detainer** as this will prevent you from attending one **discussion** period. If you aren't present for **discussion**, you won't be able to use your ability.

Avoid blocking votes for the same person multiple times in a row. They will suspect you of being part of the **Mafia** and convince the server to eliminate you.

You don't have to use your ability every single round, but it is recommended to do so. This is because it will get the server talking, therefore you and the **Civilians** have more of a chance to beat the **Mafia**.

Remember that you are still a **Civilian**. You must survive the **night** as efficiently as possible.

Do not stay quiet as you will be eliminated for being quiet by the server as they may suspect you of being part of the **Mafia**.

If you are accused of being part of the **Mafia**, try and block votes from the person accusing you. This could work two ways: they realise you aren't part of the **Mafia**, or they may eliminate you if they are part of the **Mafia** for blocking their votes. Make sure you know if the player accusing you is a **Civilian**.
## **Trivia**
---

In **OG Mafia**, the **Suppressor** was named the **Mutilator**, who would prevent players from talking for one round.

If the **Suppressor** blocks a player's votes, they get 1 **credit** and 2 **XP**.

The role was first introduced in the advanced game mode of **OG Mafia**.
