## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Jester** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During **discussion**, the **Jester** must try and convince the rest of the server that they are part of the **Mafia**. If they get voted out, the server is notified that the player was a **Jester** and they will strike their revenge during the upcoming night.

In return, the **Jester** gets **credits** and **XP** for their efforts, along with a **badge** if they haven't obtained it yet.

**Civilians** and the **Mafias** may hesitate to vote out the **Jester** as the **Jester** can kill anybody in the game.

During the **night**, the **Jester** creeps up on an individual and kills them by clicking on them. The targeted individual and the **Jester** both die.

The **Jester** can serve as beneficial to the **Civilians** if they convince the **Jester** to target a **Mafioso**. Alternatively, it can serve as beneficial to the **Mafias** if they convince the **Jester** to target a **Civilian**. 

If the **Jester** gets killed by the **Mafias**, the **Jester** fails their mission.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
If you get the role of the **Jester**, subtly convince the server that you are part of the **Mafia** rather than revealing your role and implying that you are a **Jester**. This is because the server will not vote you out if you reveal your role; they will be scared of the consequences which is your revenge night.

If you do not get voted out at all throughout the game and do not strike your revenge, you will not earn your reward of 20 **credits** and 40 **XP**.

Avoid getting killed during the **night** as you will not be able to strike your revenge if you are murdered. You can avoid this by mingling with large crowds of **Civilians**, or hiding in **closets** and **lockers**. 

When striking your revenge, you are immune from being murdered by the **Mafias**. You do not need to be subtle with your approach, you can go ahead and kill anybody.

You can act along with the **Civilians** if you want to, as this is pretty much a **Civilian** role but you can strike your revenge if you get voted out. But, if you stay in the game until the end, you will not get your reward.

Avoid being arrested by the **Detainer** as this will slow down your chances of being able to strike your revenge.

To pretend you are part of the **Mafia**, you can accuse a player, say you saw them next to the dead body, and more. Make it all up.
## **Trivia**
