Its ability is arresting a player during the night, preventing them from showing up for the next <b> discussion </b> round and the <b> night </b> after that. This role appears in both Normal and <b>Disguised</b> rounds.<p> The <b> Detainer </b> serves an important function to the game; the <b> Detainer </b> must try to arrest a <b> Mafioso </b> to slow down the <b> Mafias </b> from striking during the night, potentially leading to nobody dying during the <b> night </b>. Alternatively, the <b> Detainer </b> can arrest a <b> Civilian </b> to save them from being eliminated from the <b> Mafias </b>.

## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Detainer** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During the **night**, the **Detainer** must walk around the map and arrest one individual. This is done by clicking on a player. This will prevent the targeted individual from communicating, showing up during **discussion** and the **night** after that.

The arrested individual only returns to the game the **night** after the **night** they were eliminated in.

This can work two ways. Firstly, the **Detainer** can target someone they suspect of being part of the **Mafia** to prevent the **Mafioso** from striking during the next night. This can lead to the game stating that *'no players have died tonight'*, implying that no **Mafias** were present to eliminate anybody.

Secondly, the **Detainer** can target a **Civilian** if they suspect that the **Mafias** are going to target a **Civilian** for revenge. This saves the **Civilian** from elimination for one **discussion** period and one **night** period. 

Both functions serve beneficial to the **Civilians**, but **Detainers** must be careful. Arresting a **Civilian** later on in the game when there are few people left can lead to the **Mafia** winning if the number of **Evil Roles** outnumber the **Good Roles**. 

In a rare occasion, if the **Detainer** arrests a **Mafioso** near to the end of the game (given that there is only one **Mafioso** left), the **Civilians** can win as they will outnumber the amount of **Mafias** left in the game. 

It is one of the most vulnerable roles in the game as the **Mafias** will see the **Detainer** as a threat towards their chances of succession. 

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
As the **Detainer**, you are still part of the **Civilians**. You must survive each **night** and each **discussion** period to avoid being eliminated and allowing the **Mafias** to roam freely.

During the **night**, look around for suspicious activity. For example, if you find a **Mafioso** next to a dead body, arrest them immediately as they won't be able to kill you if they have killed the wounded player. In this situation, explain to the **Civilians** that you have arrested (the player's name) and they should vote them out when they return.

Try not to reveal your role unless the **Civilians** have a good chance at winning the game. If you reveal your role too early, the **Mafias** will target you immediately as you pose as a threat to them.

Keep in big crowds of **Civilians** during the night as this will lower your chances of being killed by the **Mafias**. 

Avoid arresting the **Jester** as they can target you during their revenge night. 

Avoid being cursed by the **Witch** as much as possible because if you get cursed, you cannot talk during **discussion**. **Civilians** will then suspect you of being part of the **Mafia** as you are too quiet. 

Avoid arresting the **Vigilante** at any point of the game unless you are trying to save them from murder. Arresting the **Vigilante** will make the **Civilians** more vulnerable than they already are as they do not have anybody to protect them from murder. Make sure you know who the **Vigilante** is.

When arresting **Civilians** to try and save them from the **Mafias**, make sure this is done at an early point within the game as the **Mafias** may outnumber the amount of **Civilians** left in the game, leading to **Civilians** losing the game. 

If you intentionally arrest **Civilians**, make sure you know that a **Civilian** poses a real threat to the **Mafia**. There is no point in trying to arrest a random individual. If you arrest a **Civilian** that is bound to be targeted by the **Mafias**, this can confuse the **Mafias** during the **night** as their target will be missing, allowing **Civilians** to have a better shot at succession.

Remember that you can only arrest one individual per night. Do not rush in arresting players because you may be scared a **Mafioso** may uncover your role. 

When arresting individuals, try and make sure this is done in a concealed space or small section of the map. If you arrest an individual in a large, open space, the **Mafias** have a better chance at killing you.

Do not conspire against **Civilians** as they will see you as a threat and vote you out. Remember you are part of the **Good Team**, the **Mafias** do not have your back at any point of the game. 

Avoid arresting the **Doctor** or the **Detective** as they serve as some of the most important guardians to the **Civilians**. Without a **Doctor** or a **Detective**, the **Civilians** are bound to lose. 

If the **Mafias** start targeting you during the **discussion** period, do not reveal your role unless you have already done so. Explain why you're not part of the **Evil Team** and explain your suspicions during the previous night. 

If you feel as if the **Mafias** are bound to kill you during the **night**, be sure to hide in a **closet** or a **locker**. They may get confused and start wandering around the map, prone to being suspected by more **Civilians**.
