## **In-Game**
---
On a 20 player server, the chance of obtaining the **Vigilante** role is 5%. This increases to 10% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

On a 10 player server, this chance increases to 10%, doubling to 20% if the player has the **Role Booster** game pass.

During the **night**, the **Vigilante** must walk around the map and look for suspicious activity. If they find suspicious activity, such as witnessing a **Mafioso** shooting somebody, they can aim at their target and kill them.

If the **Vigilante** shoots a **Mafioso** or **Witch** during the night, the **Vigilante** will survive and continue playing.

If the **Vigilante** shoots a **Civilian** during the night, the **Vigilante** will kill themselves and the **Civilian**. 

The target that has been killed by the **Vigilante** cannot return to the game.

During **discussion**, the **Vigilante** cannot kill anybody. They can only strike during the **night** period.

This role is one of the most beneficial roles to the **Civilians** as the **Vigilante** acts as a physical guardian preventing the **Mafias** from striking.

It is also one of the most vulnerable roles in the game as it acts as the biggest threat to the **Mafias**. If a **Mafioso** eliminates a **Vigilante**, the **Vigilante** cannot return to the game.

The **Vigilante** shoots somebody by clicking on them during the **night**.

## **Tips and Tricks**
---
*In this section, **Mafias** define the **Mafia** and the **Witch** if the **Witch** is part of the **Evil Team**.*

As the **Vigilante**, you must try and avoid death or being voted out as much as possible. You pose as the biggest threat to the **Mafias**. Do this by engaging with large crowds of **Civilians** during the **night** to avoid being murdered. Be careful with this though, try not to aim at a **Civilian**.

It is advised to not reveal your role at any point of the game as the **Mafias** will see you as their biggest threat. 

**Mafias** can also surround you before they kill you as both the **Mafia** and the **Vigilante** only have one shot. If you suspect of somebody being a **Mafioso**, creep up on only one of them and shoot them before they kill you.

Avoid getting arrested by the **Detainer** as this will allow **Civilians** to become more vulnerable than they already are. If the **Civilians** don't have a physical guardian protecting them, the **Mafias** are way more powerful than they already are.

Do not shoot the **Jester**. They are a **Neutral Role**. Shooting the **Jester** is the same as shooting a **Civilian**. 

Make sure you know what side the **Witch** is on. If you shoot a **Witch** part of the **Good Team**, you will go down with them. If the **Witch** is on the **Evil Team**, they will be killed and you will survive.

Avoid confusing **Civilians** with the fact you have a **gun**. Some **Civilians** may not be familiar with the **Vigilante** role and may see you as part of the **Mafia** instead. They can use this against you during **discussion** time.

Try and figure out who the **Detective** is as early as possible as they will be most likely following the footsteps of the **Mafia** during the night. If the **Detective** meets their target, you can shoot the target before the **Mafias** get the both of you.

Work with the **Doctor**: they are alerted when a body is wounded. They will most likely be following the area as to where a body is wounded, with suspicious people gathering round the body.

Search **closets** and **lockers** around areas where a body has been killed as they may have suspicious people inside of them. Make sure they are actually suspicious though. If you shoot the wrong person, you go down with them.

If you do shoot a **Mafioso** and the game doesn't end, don't worry. The eliminated **Mafioso** won't have access to their private chat, so therefore cannot communicate who shot them. 

If you are accused of being a **Mafioso**, explain why it's not you but do not reveal your role. Explain your suspicions during the night but don't put the blame onto anybody else, they are bound to target you.

Make sure to communicate during **discussion** time and do not remain silent. The **Mafias** will use this character flaw against you and accuse you of being a **Mafioso**.
## **Trivia**
---

The role was introduced first in the advanced game mode of **OG Mafia**.

The **Vigilante** does not have to kill somebody every night.

Shooting a **Mafioso** gives the **Vigilante** 8 **credits** and 16 **XP**.

In **OG Mafia**, the **Vigilante** was forced to kill somebody every night.

Their **gunshot** has the same noise level as a **Mafioso's** gunshot.

If the **Vigilante** dies, the server is notified that the eliminated player was a **Vigilante**. 

The **Vigilante** does not have a **knife**, whereas the **Mafias** do.

The **Vigilante**, in a 20 player server, has a 15% chance of shooting a **Mafioso**. This increases to 20% in a 10 player server.

Despite belief, the **Vigilante** in fact can kill a **Witch** if they are on the **Evil Team**.
