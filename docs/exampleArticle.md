## **Introduction**
---

Welcome to the example article. Writing an article for this wiki might look difficult given the syntax of **Markdown**, but if you take a look at the source code for it you'll soon find writing articles a breeze. In fact, you're given far greater artistic liberty this way, so in the long term it should be benefitial for you.

## **Using Markdown**
---

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for creating formatted text. The Mafia Wiki uses **[Material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)**, a wiki generator that converts Markdown (`.md`) files to a wiki page, which makes writing and adding new articles easy. Another benefit is that the entire site is static, meaning that setting the wiki up is not only easier but cheaper for us on our behalf.

A great way to get started with writing markdown is installing the note app **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**. Obsidian uses Markdown and saves its files as `.md` files, which also makes it convenient as you can just upload the `.md` file to the wiki and it'll generate a webpage for you.
If you'd like to avoid downloading any software or using Obsidian in general, you can also use [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io).
