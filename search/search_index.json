If you do decide to hide in a closet, make sure to peek out of it every 15-20 seconds to see if anybody's near you.</p> <p>If you are part of the Mafia, this map is very difficult to orchestrate killings in. Visit the 'Storage' room and the sitting room to see if any Civilians are hiding in there, so you can kill them without alerting everybody who may be in the 'Grand Foyer'.

Civilians who get themselves stuck in the 'Upper Landing' don't have a way out if you surround them.</p> <p>This map is also difficult for the Detective. If you are a Detective, try and look for footsteps, using your special ability, in smaller rooms such as the 'Storage' room, 'Upper Landing', or the sitting room. Footsteps are more likely to show up and stay in smaller rooms rather than huge spaces such as the 'Grand Foyer'.</p> <p>Avoid getting stuck on either side of the first floor as these landings (with bookshelves on the sides) are dead ends. </p> <p>If you are a Witch, try and curse people in smaller rooms too. Alerting everybody around you, such as in the 'Grand Foyer', will expose your role to everybody in the game, causing them to vote you out no matter what side you're on.</p> <p>Avoid getting stuck in 'Staircase A'. This staircase is very long. It allows members of the Mafia to trap Civilians in this staircase, and vice versa.</p> <p>If you are a Doctor, make sure to keep central to the 'Grand Foyer' as this will give you easy transportation to get to each room in the map. If you hear a wounded player, or an attack being orchestrated, you can easily define where the sound is coming from and go towards the area.</p> <p>No matter your role, make sure to look behind you every few seconds.

Writing an article for this wiki might look difficult given the fact that there's no built-in editor like Fandom has, but once you see how the source file of this page looks like and study it enough, you'll soon find writing articles pretty easy.

The Mafia Wiki uses Material for mkdocs, a wiki generator that converts Markdown (<code>.md</code>) files to a wiki page, which makes writing and adding new articles easy. Another benefit is that the entire site is static, meaning that setting the wiki up is not only easier but cheaper for us on our behalf.</p> <p>A great way to get started with writing markdown is installing the note app Obsidian. Obsidian uses Markdown and saves its files as <code>.md</code> files, which also makes it convenient as you can just upload the <code>.md</code> file to the wiki and it'll generate a webpage for you. If you'd like to avoid downloading any software or using Obsidian in general, you can also use stackedit.io.</p> <p>Now, about writing articles. The best way to write an article is to use this example article as a template. You can copy the source code of this page and paste it into your own <code>.md</code> file, then modify the content to fit your article. You can also use the Markdown Guide to learn more about Markdown. When modifying the article, make sure to not mess around with the introduction paragraph, except where you can see plain text, as it's styled with HTML tags and not Markdown, and modifying it might break the infobox that can be seen on the right side of the page (or at the top if you're on mobile). After you've completed the introduction paragraph, you can write the rest of the article in Markdown.</p> <p>Additionally, there's an page on this Wiki that contains an example of every Markdown feature you can use.

On the other hand, the <code>background</code> attribute is used to set the background image of the article. You can use any image you want, but make sure it's at least 1920x1080 pixels in size for best results.

You would want a tie to happen if half of the server is accusing a Civilian and the other half is accusing somebody who is part of the Mafia. If you try and make a tie happen, the Judge will therefore vote out the member of the Mafia rather than the Civilian.</p> <p>Try and avoid being arrested by the Detainer as this will prevent you from attending one discussion period.

They will suspect you of being part of the Mafia and convince the server to eliminate you.</p> <p>You don't have to use your ability every single round, but it is recommended to do so. This is because it will get the server talking, therefore you and the Civilians have more of a chance to beat the Mafia.</p> <p>Remember that you are still a Civilian.
